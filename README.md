# Ethics In Tech

As self-driving cars become more prevalent, difficult ethical decisions loom on the horizon, particularly regarding potential no-win crash scenarios. Attorney Van Lindberg warns that despite autonomous vehicles saving many lives, there will inevitably be accidents involving unpredictable circumstances like falling trees or sudden pedestrian appearances. These ethical questions are currently largely unaddressed in public discourse and legislation, despite the increase in the number of autonomous vehicles on the roads. A legislation is moving through Congress potentially leading to tens of thousands of self-driving cars on the roads, without addressing these concerns. The U.S. Department of Transportation has only lightly touched upon the ethical considerations, acknowledging the importance but also noting that no consensus has been reached.

# Ethics in the work place

The narrator, who began coding at a young age, worked at an interactive marketing firm in Toronto, where he was tasked with creating a website for a drug aimed at teenage girls. A key feature of the site was a quiz that recommended the drug based on users' responses, a tactic that, in hindsight, raised significant ethical concerns. At the time, the narrator viewed it as a marketing strategy rather than a potential ethical dilemma. However, a tragic incident where a young girl committed suicide after taking the drug he had built the website for, starkly highlighted the ethical considerations that coders need to grapple with, particularly when their work could potentially influence vulnerable individuals.
