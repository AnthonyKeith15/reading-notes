## How the web works

### Clients and servers

Computers connected to the internet are called **clients** and **servers**

**Clients** are the typical web user internet-connected devices (I.E. Computers connected to the wifi/phone connected to the mobile network)

**Servers** are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. When a client wants to get access, a **copy** of the page is downloaded from the server on to the client machine and displayed in the users web browser.

#### Other important roles

**Internet Connection** allows user to send and recieve data on the web

**TCP/IP** Tansmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol. Defines how data should travel across the internet. It is similar to a mode of transportation that says how we should get arround

**DNS** Domain Name System. Similar to an address book. The browser needs to figure out which server the website lives on before it can comminucate with it

**HTTP**  Hypertext transfer protocol. This defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other

**Component Files** A website made up of different files and parts
-Code Files: Websites built primarily from HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-Assets: Collective name for all the other stuff such as images, music, PDFs etc.

### DNS Explained

**Domain Name Servers** are the special servers that match up to the web address (Such as Facebook.com, Google.com etc)

Websites can be reached directly via IP address

### Packets Explained 

Data isnt sent in one big chunk, it is sent across thousands of smaller chunks. They're sent this way because its easier to replace in case of data corruption. Also the packets can be routed along different paths, making it faster and letting different users access it at the same time.
